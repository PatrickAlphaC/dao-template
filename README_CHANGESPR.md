Pull Request Report: DAO Project Update
Summary

This Pull Request introduces significant changes to the DAO project, aiming to optimize the codebase, improve compliance with standards, and update dependencies. Below are the key changes.
Changes
Function Calls Syntax Update

    Before: Used ContractName.functionName() for invoking contract functions.
    After: Moved to ContractName.getFunction("functionName")(args).

This change was made to align the function calling mechanism with new best practices and to improve code readability.
Dependency Cleanup

    Removed: Packages like types-chains and waffle were removed from package.json.
    Rationale: These functionalities are already provided by hardhat-toolbox and hardhat-ethers, making the removed packages redundant.

Contract Updates
ERC20Permit Changes

    Before: Used draft-ERC20Permit.sol.
    After: Moved to ERC20Permit.sol.

Reason: OpenZeppelin has officially deprecated draft-ERC20Permit.sol in favor of ERC20Permit.sol as per EIP-2612 becoming a standard rather than a draft (#3793).
Deprecation of Timers

    Noted the deprecation of the Timers library, which will be removed in the next major release as per OpenZeppelin (#4062).

Configuration Changes
Hardhat Config

    Before: Old import files and paths.
    After: Updated the import files in hardhat.config.ts.

This change improves the build and compilation process by ensuring all dependencies are up to date.
Slither Version Update

    Updated the version of OpenZeppelin contracts to make it compatible with Slither static analysis.
